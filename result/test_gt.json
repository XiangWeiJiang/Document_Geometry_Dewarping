But this technique is not only about looking at your data\n\nat ditiereni scale levels. Underlying this technique is the idea that we need to expand our\n\nunderstanding by aggregating the data.\n\nOne technique that makes it Gasy to compare Gata at ditferent scale levels is to use an\n\nindex, For example, let s say that trom the mass spectrometer technique, we learn that our\n\ntarget population is 18- to 34-year-olds who make up 24 percent of the total population\n\nOf the country. We can measure that same target population percentage at tne census\n\nblock group level, or by ZIP coce, trade area, county, metropolitan area, or state level. By\n\nf\n\ndividing each areas percentage by 24 percent and multiplying by 100, we can create an\n\nindex that compares any Value to the base population percentage.\n\nWhile it is relatively Gasy to remember a single benchmark like 24 percent, the value\n\n.\n\nOf Converting ail your variables to an index based on 100 is that you will be able to scan\n\nmultiple variables and have an almost instant understanding of how any given area relates\n\nto the overall population based on an average, median, percentage, a target number, or a\n\nke\n\nthreshold value.\n\nwy\n\n3 THE MICROSCOPE\n\n.\n\nInsome Ways, the microscope is simply the lip side of the telescope technique: drilling down\n\nte\n\nto a small area with more details rather than aggregating Gata Up to a larger geographic\n\narea.
